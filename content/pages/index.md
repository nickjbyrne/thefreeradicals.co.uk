Based in Surrey, England, **THE FREE RADICALS** play folk music taking inspiration from traditional celtic music, bluegrass, Ukrainian dance music, and other influences mixing it together to produce a unique sound. Taking the basic four instruments of mandolin, guitar, bass and spoons, with occasional fiddle, harp and percussion, TFR have a distinctly acoustic vibe, but don't conform to the traditionalist image of many modern-day folk bands. Born in the pubs of Godalming, Surrey, TFR are essentially a live act, but have spent time in the studio to produce two albums 'Out Of The Hedge' and 'Hydon's Ball' which have an electric and psychedelic edge to their normal acoustic sound. You can catch the band at one of our local gigs in pubs or at festivals in Surrey and Sussex.  You are guaranteed a rip-roaring, foot-tapping time!

One evening down the local pub, we started to invent medieval style words for measurements and distances, for instance a Nos'with (Nostril's Width although there is an argument between an Abbot's Nos'With and the King's Nos'with depending on who is King or Abbot at the time), a Farkle (the width of a bees buttocks), a Svend (typical Toad's leap) and some Grain (how far a man can typically throw seed i.e 'a stone's throw' but also referring to the grain that goes to make the beer the Man has been drinking) and then those 'Words and Meanings' (which can be seen at the end of the video) were used to write the song!

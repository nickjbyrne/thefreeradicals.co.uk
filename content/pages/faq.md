Title: Frequently Asked Questions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much do you charge?**

Typically £200-£300 per gig - contact us to discuss.

**How long do you play for?**

For a typical pub gig we would play two sets of approx. 45 mins, but can adapt our set to suit the gig.

**What equipment do you bring?**

We supply all our own equipment including PA and lights.

**How much space do you need?**

We can try to fit into any venue! But don't forget there are four of us, and we have a dedicated soundman to control the PA. We would need space for up to four mic stands, two PA speaker stands, and somewhere to set up the mixing desk in front of the band.

**When are you usually available?**

We prefer weekends (we all have day jobs!) - days or evenings.

**What else do you need?**

A stool for the spoonsman, one or two 13-amp plug sockets, and a willing audience!

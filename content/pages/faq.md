**How much space do you need?**
{: .is-size-4 }

We can try to fit into any venue! But don't forget there are four of us, and we have a dedicated soundman to control the PA. We would need space for up to four mic stands, two PA speaker stands, and somewhere to set up the mixing desk in front of the band.
